## Code Review

For a brief description of the importance of code review, please read On Code Review.
There are two aspects of code review: giving and receiving.

To make it easier for your PR to receive reviews, consider the reviewers will need you to:

* follow the project coding conventions
* write good commit messages
* break large changes into a logical series of smaller patches which individually make easily understandable changes, and in aggregate solve a broader issue
* label PRs with appropriate SIGs and reviewers: to do this read the messages the bot sends you to guide you through the PR process

Reviewers, the people giving the review, are highly encouraged to revisit the Code of Conduct as well as community expectations and must go above and beyond to promote a collaborative, respectful community. When reviewing PRs from others The Gentle Art of Patch Review suggests an iterative series of focuses which is designed to lead new contributors to positive collaboration without inundating them initially with nuances:

* Is the idea behind the contribution sound?
* Is the contribution architected correctly?
* Is the contribution polished?

Note: if your pull request isn't getting enough attention, you can use the #pr-reviews channel on Slack to get help finding reviewers.
