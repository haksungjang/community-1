# Targeting enhancements, Issues and PRs to Release Milestones (필요시 제목 수정) 

This document is focused on Kubernetes developers and contributors who need to
create an enhancement, issue, or pull request which targets a specific release
milestone. (본 페이지 설명)


The process for shepherding enhancements, issues, and pull requests into a
Kubernetes release spans multiple stakeholders: (릴리즈 절차 및 유관부서/조직/담당자 안내)

- the enhancement, issue, and pull request owner(s)
- SIG leadership
- the [Release Team][release-team]

Information on workflows and interactions are described below. (필요시 수정사용) 

As the owner of an enhancement, issue, or pull request (PR), it is your
responsibility to ensure release milestone requirements are met. Automation and
the Release Team will be in contact with you if updates are required, but
inaction can result in your work being removed from the milestone. Additional
requirements exist when the target milestone is a prior release (see
[cherry pick process][cherry-picks] for more information).
